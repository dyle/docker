# docker

This is my personal collection of Dockerfiles.

The Dockerfiles create images with
* my personal shell look&feel
* my vim settings
* GNU screen settings
* build-essential (gcc, make, ...)
* tree and htop
* curl and wget

The resulting image fits *my* needs. Feel free to use them if you want to.
